# Theme Variable Names

Theme variable names are in this order:

`component hierarchy -> component -> component state -> color role -> color variant `

Examples:

- main-bg 

  >  "main" is the document, the root component. "bg" is the color role.

- switch-off-hover-bg

  > `component -> component state -> component state -> color role`

- sidebar-mark-bg

  > `component -> component -> color role`

- main-fg-dimmer

  > `component -> color role -> color variant`
